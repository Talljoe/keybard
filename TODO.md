# TODO

 - Protocol:
   - Macros now fetch and push the entire 798 byte macro memory. Should
     only fetch and pull until the macro_count'th null byte.
 
 - Adding documentation and help windows or context links to explain things.
 
 - Example layers.
   - Fn
   - Mice
 
 - Example full .kbis - all 16 layers, macros, combos, etc.
   - DH QWERTY
   - HRM/BRM examples.

 - UI design improvements. Ongoing and constant =).
   - Custom names for layers. Maybe combos and tap dances.
   - Layer toggles rather than MO/TT/DF/OSL for every #?
     e.g: "(MO-Momentary) (DF - Default) (OSL - One Shot)" "0 1 2 3 ..."
